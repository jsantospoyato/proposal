# Proposal APP

## Author: Juan Santos Poyato

## Objetive of this app

Implementing an app that consists on a basic GUI asking a person a loving question, with comical purposes.

## Behaviour of the app

It has 3 main behavioural patterns:

- When trying to close the window, it tells the user that they need to choose an answer and rerun the app, making it impossible to close directly.
- When trying to click 'NO', the button moves away, make it so it looks like is avoiding the user "clicks" and so avoiding the answer that is not desired.
- When trying to click 'YES', a loving message shows up and the app finally closes.

It was intended to practice development of an app with a simple UI, while forcing a restricted conduct on the user. This idea would be good to use on applications where something is required before finishing and the result of not doing it is not desirable or it is basically needed to continue.

## Libraries used

Tkinter and PIL;
